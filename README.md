### What is Golden Times?
Golden Times is a platform where people over the age of 60 can enjoy activities and interact with others who have similar interests and are around their age.

### How It Works
**1.** When the site is first opened up, the home page appears.

**2.** New users can register for an account, which requires their name, age, area code/postcode, mobile number, email, and password.

**3.** The user is then redirected to the login page, and logs in with their email and password.

**4.** After logging in, the user is taken back to the home page. Their name now displays at the top in the menu bar, confirming that they are logged in.

**5.** In the feed page, the user can view the last ten posts published. There is a matching score titled "Post Matching Rating" at the bottom of each post. The more interests/categories you have selected in your profile and the more categories that a post has in common with your interests, the higher the matching rating will be.

**6.** The user can select their interests/categories. Below, the user has selected "Chit-chat," "Other countries," and "Lunch."
